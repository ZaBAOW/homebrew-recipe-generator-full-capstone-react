## Userflow
The user will begin on the Landing page in a "Logged Out" version of the
site with the immediate option to sign up and create an account.  If this user
does not wish to create an account they can visit the browser page to search
for different type of existing brew recipes.  Or if the user already has an
account created, they can go to the login page and log in to their account from
there.  If the user decide to create an account, if their input meets the conditions for a valid
account, they will be immediately logged in.  This will render the "Logged In"
version of the site.  They will then have access to the dashboard page, which
from there allows users access to both the recipe creation page and their recipe
archive page.  When a user is done they will log out by simple clicking the
"Log Out" link in the navigation bar and will be sent back to the login page.

## Functionality
 - Users will have the ability to create their own account for the website
 - Users will be able to generate their own homebrew recipes for the websites database
    and subsequently 'POST' them
 - Users will be able to browse all recipes posted to the database and select them in order to
    view them
